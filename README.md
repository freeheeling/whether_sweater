### Project Description
As a back-end developer working on a team that is building an application to plan road trips, this app allows users to see the current weather as well as the forecasted weather at a destination.

Working in a service-oriented architecture, the front-end communicates with the back-end through an API. This service exposes that API and satisfies the front-end teamâ€™s requirements.

### Learning Goals
- Expose an API that aggregates data from multiple external APIs
- Expose an API that requires an authentication token
- Expose an API for CRUD functionality
- Determine completion criteria based on the needs of other developers
- Research, select, and consume an API based on own needs as a developer
